How is structured\+: -\/custom libraries in src and include to implement functions -\/main.\+cpp file where functions can be called and tested

U\+S\+A\+GE\+: -\/to use this code you need to replace \char`\"{}locosi/cpp\char`\"{} contents with this repo -\/to execute main\+: rosrun lab\+\_\+paolopoli main

T\+O\+\_\+\+DO\+: -\/in order to better organize code is necessary to create classes and possibly separate differnatial kinematics functions from normal kinmatics functions

N\+O\+TE\+: -\/avoid using global variables in main.\+cpp (th varaible was moved locally)

S\+I\+D\+E-\/\+N\+O\+T\+ES\+: In order to make rotations of blocks work you need\+: -\/reduce gravity at -\/3 \mbox{[}m/s$^\wedge$2\mbox{]} -\/set all the params of the objets to 0.\+2 of inertia -\/set block mass at 0.\+01 (other params configs are possible this is the first one that worked for me)
